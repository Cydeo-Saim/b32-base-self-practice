Practice Steps with commands

Fork the project
Open the command line and navigate to the desktop
	cd desktop

Then clone the forked project
	-> we forked and clone our own project to be able to make changes in it

	git clone url

Open the project in IntelliJ

Make a local develop branch

	git branch develop

Set the upstream branch

	git branch -u origin/develop

	If you see branch doesn't exist
	-> if we didn't have a develop branch on the remote, we had to make one first
	-> if it was not updated, just made a new branch, then we can fetch to force an update and this allowed us to set the upstream

Created your own branch(name, feat, test, user story)

	git branch name

Make changes in a file

	check the status of the files  -> can be run anytime to check the progress/changes in the local repository. Not mandatory for other steps to work
		git status

Stage the file: selecting which files will be commit

	git add .
		-> this will stage ALL the files that have new changes

	git add fileName
		-> verify your location in the command line

Commit the changes

	git commit -m "message here"

Push the changes to a new remote branch

	git push -u origin name

	in the future we can write just: git push
		we can do just this command because there is a remote branch with the name and they are connected

Make pull request to develop branch

	=== finished upstream flow

Make a change directly on github in the develop branch

checkout to local develop

	git checkout develop

	fetch - optional

pull changes to update our local develop

	git pull
		-> connected to the upstream, so we can do just git pull, instead of: git pull origin/develop

update our local name/feat branch

	git checkout name
	git merge develop

	=== finished downstream flow
